The primary features of our application will be allowing students to upload their study materials, lecture notes and research papers as a file (PDF,text) and the application will automatically summaries the notes to make studies easier. Additionally, students can ask question related to their study materials, and system will provide answers relevant to their study materials. Furthermore, another important feature of StudyMate AI is its ability to generate model question papers based on the uploaded study materials. It will allow students to practice the papers and track their learning patterns, strengths and weakness using machine learning algorithms and give feedbacks to improve their study habits. The development of this application will use advanced technologies, including machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), and android mobile app development frameworks. And the application will be designed with user friendly interfaces to ease the accessibility for students of all levels. Overall, our project targets to empower students with the facilities and resources they need to succeed in their studies. By utilizingthe power of AI technologies, we want to revolutionize the way of studentâ€™s self-directed learning and achieve their goals', current_timestamp )
